# Assumptions made after the completion of the URL hashing system in Django:

- The original URLs stored in the database will not be modified or deleted.
- The URL hashing function implemented is secure and unique, and there is no risk of hash collisions.
- The privacy awareness feature of the hashed URLs is implemented and tested thoroughly.
- The click tracking functionality works correctly and accurately counts the number of clicks on each hashed URL.
- The limit feature of the hashed URLs is implemented and tested thoroughly.
- The URL hashing system is deployed in a production environment, and all necessary security measures are taken to ensure the system's safety and reliability.
- The system is designed to handle a large number of requests and scale up as needed.
- Any future updates or modifications to the URL hashing system will be made with the necessary testing and documentation to maintain the system's integrity and functionality.
